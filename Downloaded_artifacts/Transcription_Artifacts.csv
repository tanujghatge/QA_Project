You all have heard about the Titanic. Today, let me tell you about Titan. A massive search operation is underway in the Atlantic Ocean, the world's second largest ocean, and this in order to rescue five people who had gone on an expedition to watch the remains of the Titanic at 12,500 feet below the sea surface. They were in a submersible called Titan which is bolted from outside. The oxygen inside that vessel is running out. And by the time you watch this video it is possible that the oxygen might run out. Teams from America, Canada and France are trying to search one of the deepest parts of the Atlantic Oceans but there's no luck yet. It seems like an impossible race against time. It's been over 4 days now and nobody knows where Titan is and what happened to it. On the whole story, let's try to understand why this missing submersible has caught the world's attention. The small craft named Titan is owned by undersea exploration company Ocean Gate Expeditions. It's been taking tourists to see the remains of Titanic since 2021. The cost of the ticket is $250,000 or roughly 2 crore rupees a person. It's an 8-day trip that includes dives to the wreck at the depth of almost 12,500 feet. A full dive to the Titanic wreck, including the descent and ascent, reportedly takes eight hours. A maximum of six people above the age of 17 years are allowed on board. So where is the Titanic wreckage? It is about 700 km south of St. John's, Newfoundland in Canada. At least 46 people have successfully travelled on ocean Gate submersible to the Titanic wreck site in 2021 and 2022. What is it like to be in that submersible? It's not a submarine. It's a submersible that has limited power reserves and needs a support ship on the surface to launch and recover it. Titan typically spends about 10-11 hours during each trip to the Titanic wreck, while submarines can stay underwater for months. It is roughly the size of a minivan or a small car. It weighs about 20,000 pounds or about 9,071 kilograms and is made of carbon fibre and titanium. There's only one toilet and no seats. All passengers must sit cross-legged on the floor. There are no windows except for the porthole through which passengers can see the Titanic remains. Reports say parts of Titan are low-tech and is operated by a gaming controller that looks like a Playstation controller. So what happened on Sunday? This tourist submarine lost touch about an hour and 45 minutes into its dive about 1,400 kilometers east of Cape Cod in Massachusetts. A search operation was launched immediately. Government agencies, the US and Canadian navies and commercial deep-sea companies are helping in the rescue operation. As of Wednesday, searchers had covered an area twice the size of Connecticut in waters and this operation continued overnight as well. Who all are missing? The missing include Ocean Gate CEO and founder Stockton Rush, British businessman Hamish Harding, French diver Paul Henry, Pakistani billionaire Shahzada Daud and his son Suleyman Daud. According to the New York Times, the wife of missing Ocean Gate CEO is the great-great granddaughter of a couple that died on Titanic. How bad is it? What are the challenges for the rescue teams? Well, it is pitch dark, 12,500 feet deep, freezing cold, the oxygen is running out, no visibility, experts say you can't see your hand in front of your face. Finding it will be like finding a needle in a haystack. If it returned to the surface, it would be difficult for the people to come out as this vessel has been locked from outside with 17 bolts. It's like being in a cramped snow cave. There was some hope as rescue teams heard some banging noises from its last known location. But the US Coast Guard has confirmed that banging noises that were heard did not come from the Titan. A French robot that can dive up to 19,600 feet is among the equipment that's being deployed to search for the missing submersible. A lot of people are asking whether this company was authorized to undertake such risky Titanic trips. Could this have been avoided? The owner of the company, who organized the expedition and is also missing, had once famously said, If you want to be safe, don't get out of bed. The questions about Titan's safety were always there. Documents show that Ocean Gate had been warned that there might be catastrophic safety problems posed by the way this vessel was developed. A former employee had said in a lawsuit that the company's testing and certification was that there might be catastrophic safety problems posed by the way this vessel was developed. A former employee had said in a lawsuit that the company's testing and certification was insufficient and would subject passengers to potential extreme danger in an experimental submersible. you"

Low lying areas, VIP areas, main roads, even the mighty Red Fort. Nothing has been spared. On the whole story, let me tell you about the key reasons why the Yamuna's levels are at record high, how bad the situation is and why our cities are unable to handle excessive rains. The Yamuna River's water level is 3 meters above the danger level at 208.62 meters. It is at an all-time high. The previous high was in 1978 when the water level breached 207.49 meters mark leading to massive floods. It is possible that by the time you watch this video, there is a slight change in the water levels. The danger mark is at 205.33 meters. And as per protocol, evacuation starts when the water level crosses 206 meters. A danger mark at a river location signifies a level at which a flood may occur. The situation is grim in the national capital. Over 16,000 people living in high risk low, low-lying areas near the Yamuna have been evacuated. About 14,534 are in government-arranged relief camps. Major roads are flooded. Schools and colleges are shut till Sunday. Office-goers have been urged to work from home. The water from overflowing Yamuna has entered ISBT road, Migambodh Ghat road, Indira Gandhi Stadium road, Ring road near ITO, GT Karnal road, Old Yamuna bridge which is also known as Loha pull and other low lying areas near Kashmiri gate. Why is Delhi witnessing such extreme weather conditions? Why all of a sudden? The main reason is extreme rainfall in hilly areas like Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. In simple words, Yamuna river covers areas of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh along with Delhi. Now in Delhi, the excess water due to these rains has gotten collected at Hatnikund Barrage which is situated in Haryana. A name you might have heard quite a lot these days. A barrage is an artificial barrier across a river that is used to prevent flooding, help in irrigation or to generate electricity. So during extreme rains when the water level goes beyond this barrage's capacity to hold it, this water, the excess water is released into the Yamuna river. The water that is released to Delhi takes around 2-3 days to reach. There is no other option but to release the excess water. Yesterday Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Union Home Minister Amit Shah seeking his intervention to reduce the flow of water released from the Hathnikund Barrage. But the government responded saying that the Hathnikund Barrage is not a reservoir so there is no provision to stop the flow of water. Experts have also attributed this excess rains and flooding to construction of homes and colonies in Yamuna flood plains and hilly areas of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Basic science! Overconstruction in the hilly areas has led to cutting of trees, leading to soil erosion that eventually leads to landslides. Slopes are being cut to make way for highways. Experts say that the hilly areas and over construction in low-lying areas near rivers and flood plains, these people are sitting on a time bomb and that may explode anytime soon because rules have been violated, warnings have been ignored and nature's balance has been tampered with. Another reason for excessive rains and flooding is climate change. Extreme weather conditions that are occurring more regularly are a result of climate change and a massive transformation in the rainfall pattern. Earlier rainfall used to be around 30 to 40 mm average per hour now it is 60 to 80 mm per hour. The quantum of rains that would fall over two to three days is now occurring in 10-24 hours. Another big reason is casual attitude towards desilting the Yamuna river. In simple words, desilting is basically cleaning of the river. It is believed to stop floods, however, it has some negative impact also. Delhiites have been subjected to politics over desilting of Yamuna. The big question is what next? Will the situation improve? It is expected that the quatrain of water that will be released again will be less as the rains have stopped in some parts or they are minimal in the hilly areas. But this flooding in Delhi will take 2-3 days to recede as per experts. Monsoons are India's lifeline but they also bring destruction and deaths along. Heavy rainfall in North India has caused significant devastation, with the overall death toll rising to over 90 in Himachal Pradesh, and additional deaths reported in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan. The idea is not to spread panic, but to hope that the situation gets better soon. but to hope that the situation gets better soon."
